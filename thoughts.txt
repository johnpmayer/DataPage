maybe i don't need singletons or reflection

just make a storable instance for schemas

prepend it with an int so you know how far to look

ugh that sucks that I have to read all of that and keep track, but oh well

it seems then that I'll have to loop through to get at it

so system table 1: actually just a list of (header,column type) pairs

system table 2 is the huge allocation table
